    // Functions to be implemented //

General functions :
    
    - Start control

    - Stop control
    
    - Disp dish and oven measured temperature
    
    - Disp current time since simulation started and time left
    
Control functions:

    - ssController init (4 matrices A, B, C, D) --> Could be an object

    - Next iteration calculation (x_{i+1} and y_{i}) (and time measurement) --> In ssController object
    
    - Input generation (first order response that depends of input core temperature and baking time)
    
Oven communication:

    - Read KTF value

    - Write oven reference temperature for each iteration (and mode for init)
